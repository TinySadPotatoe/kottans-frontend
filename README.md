## About Git
Now I have learned a few new things about git. It was interesting and I'm sure that I will come back to this in order to refresh my knowledge


## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I used to work with Linux, but some things - new for me. I hope, what learn even more new. HTTP - it's hard, many new definitions. But I think that over time I will understand this much better.
